// Adding key/value pairs to objects
// don't modify the object here

let fruitBasket = {
    apple: "red",
    blackberry: "black",
    orange: "orange",
};
  
// Add the other fruits and colors using dot notation below
// NOTE: Remember that they are case-senstive

fruitBasket['banana'] = "yellow";
fruitBasket['avocado'] = "green";
fruitBasket['strawberry'] = "red";
